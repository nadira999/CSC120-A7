Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the cafe.java, the sellCoffee and restockCoffee are overloaded in that restockCoffee beside all the inputs in sellCoffee, takes ncups and nCoffeeOunces as input. Moreover, I made an overloaded constructor in the library where the first one didn't take and input. However, the 2nd constructor took address as the input. This is because beside helping the code look clean and readable, the overloaded method makes the code reproducible and decrease any chances of errors. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
If I were to do this assgnment together. I would try to have fun with it and make more of my methods overloadded. Also, I would suggest myself and other to think of the assingment as something they enjoy doing not as something they have to or are forced to do.
